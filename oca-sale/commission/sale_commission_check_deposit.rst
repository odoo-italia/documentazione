The module allows you to integrate check deposit with agent commissions.

When generating agent settlements, select a
payment date until which commissions should be settled.

Invoices with checks payment will be taken
into consideration only if the number of
days set in the "Safety days for commission"
field in journal configuration from due date
set in check payment have passed from settlement payment date.

Eg:

- Invoice 0001 is paid with check
- Check due date: January 1st
- "Safety days for commission" set in check journal: 10
- In settlement wizard:
    - Settle commissions until payment date: January 5th => commission is not settled for check
    - Settle commissions until payment date: January 15th => commission is settled for check

Usage
=====

For setting journal as Check journal with safety days:

#. Go to *Journal*.
#. Check "Is check Journal" and add safety days.

For pay and register a checks deposit:

#. Create an invoice and using Checks to pay it.
#. Add a new checks deposit adding that payment.

For settling the commissions to agents:

#. Go to *Sales > Commissions Management > Settle commissions*.
#. On the window that appears, you should select the date up to which you
   want to create commissions. It should be at least one day after the last
   period date. For example, if you settlements are monthly, you have to put
   at least the first day of the following month.
#. You can settle only certain agents if you select them on the "Agents"
   section. Leave it empty for settling all.
#. Click on "Make settlements" button.
#. If safety days have passed between settlement payment date and check due date,
   commission will be settled properly.
