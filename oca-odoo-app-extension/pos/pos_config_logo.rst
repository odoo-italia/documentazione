Use Cases / Context
===================

This module is useful for a company that runs stores with different
brandings. To have a logo from the main branch is weird for the customer
of those branded stores.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

-  Go to *Point of sale > Configuration > Point of sale*
-  Select the point of sale for which you wish to change the logo.
-  Set the *Alternative point of sale logo* setting on and upload the
   desired logo.

From now on, that point of sale will print that logo, while the others
will print the company one.

Usage
=====

When the cashier prints a receipt the point of sale logo will show up in
the receipt.
