This module extends Stock Picking Invoicing implementation to Sale, you can define the 'Sale Invoicing Policy':

* If set to Sale Order, keep native Odoo behaviour for creation of invoices from Sale Orders.

* If set to Stock Picking, disallow creation of Invoices from Sale Orders for the cases where the Product Type are 'Product', in case of 'Service' still will be possible create from Sale Order.

For stock.moves, override price calculation that is present in stock_picking_invoicing, with the native Sale Order Line price calculation, same for the partner_id and other informations used to create the Invoice from Sale Order as such Payment Terms, Down Payments, Incoterm, Client Ref,etc by using sale methods to get data in order to avoid the necessity of 'glue modules' (small modules made just to avoid indirect dependencies), so in the case of any module include a new field in Invoice created by Sale this field also be include when created by Picking, for example the modules `Account Payment Sale`_  and `Sale Commission`_.

Installation
============

This module depends on:

* sale_management
* sale_stock
* stock_picking_invoicing
* stock_picking_invoice_link

Configuration
=============

Define 'Sale Invoicing Policy', if the invoice should be created from Sale Order or from Stock Picking, go to:

**Settings > Users & Companies > Companies**

or

**Sales > Configuration > Settings in Invoicing**

Usage
=====

If 'Stock Picking' is choose as Policy the creation of Invoice from Sale Order works only for Service lines, in the case of Sale Order has Products and Service lines will be create two Invoices.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* It is be possible reference multiple sale lines in only one invoice line, but there are a problem the field qty_invoiced in sale.order.line show the quantity of invoice line without consider, in this case, that the value is the sum of others sale lines https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/14.0/addons/sale/models/sale.py#L1230, what can make confuse the user about the real Invoiced Quantity, reference https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/77195
